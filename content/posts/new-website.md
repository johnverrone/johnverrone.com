## Why a new site?

{{< figure src="https://media.giphy.com/media/pPhyAv5t9V8djyRFJH/giphy.gif" title="Steve Francia" >}}

A good ways into 2019 now and I've been thinking a lot about how I want to develop my personal brand.
having an interest (and a bit of experience) in photography, videography, and web development, I thought this would
be a good time to experiment with freelance opportunities and to give myself a platform for showcasing my work.

I expect future posts to include minimal words and instead be rich with embedded multimedia content that I create 
and share through platforms such as Instagram and YouTube.


I look forward to beginning this journey of developing and sharing my skills and passions.
